# react-pokemon-api

This is my first React app. To help me in beginning to learn React, I followed along with Web Dev Simplified's tutorial on building a pokemon api app.  I thought this was a fun place to start, as I already built a similar app while learning vanilla JavaScript at SAIT. I added my own styling. 

I then created an Express server, and deployed the app using Heroku, with help from a tutorial on Medium. I already have experience building and deploying Node.js and Express apps so this came together rather quickly.
